# 📚 DSA Repository

This repository contains my personal practice and notes on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It includes problems and solutions across various topics like arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more — mainly in **C**, **C++** and **Python**.
